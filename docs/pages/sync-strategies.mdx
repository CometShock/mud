# Synchronization Strategies

For a client to show the user any information, it needs to know what is happening onchain.
There are several mechanisms you can use to read information from MUD:

1. Use the [Indexer](sync-strategies/indexer).
   The Indexer is a TypeScript service that reads information from a `World` and provides it [through HTTP](sync-strategies/indexer#using-http).

   Pro:

   - Ease of deployment.
     The Indexer is already written and [simple to deploy](sync-strategies/indexer#installation).

   Cons:

   - System complexity.
     Adding another component means another piece that could fail.
   - Centralized.
     In theory, the indexer could provide different information from what is on the chain.

1. Use the [events](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_events.htm) emitted by MUD.
   This is the default strategy used by the template provided by `pnpm create mud@<version>`.

   Pros:

   - System simplicity.
     There is no additional component that could fail.
   - Decentralized.
     The client gets the information directly from the blockchain.

   Cons:

   - Client processing cost.
     The client has to listen to all the relevant events from the world, so it has to process any change, whether it is relevant or not.

1. Query MUD onchain.

   Pros:

   - System simplicity.
     There is no additional component that could fail.
   - Decentralized.
     The client gets the information directly from the blockchain.

   Cons:

   - Expense.
     Most blockchain providers charge for view functions, because they cost processing power just as processing transactions does.
   - Speed.
     The information isn't immediately available to the client, it is only updated after a query gets to the blockchain provider and then a response gets back.
