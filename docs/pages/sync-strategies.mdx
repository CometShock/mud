# Synchronization Strategies

For a client to show the user any information, it needs to know what is happening onchain.

The initial synchronization is best done using the [Indexer](sync-strategies/indexer) to get the starting state.
This is preferable to the other option which is to look at [events](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_events.htm) beginning when the `World` was first deployed.

Once the client is in sync, it can listen to blockchain events emitted by the `World` to update the local copy of the state as needed.
