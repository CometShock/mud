# Add a system

In this tutorial you learn how to use a `World` and the systems in it from code that runs on the blockchain.
You can use this knowledge to add sub-systems to a `World` or to use MUD as part of a bigger dapp.

## Setup

[Create a minimal application](../minimal) and run it.

## Use the `World` from Foundry

As a first step, we can access the `World` from Foundry.
This is the easiest method to experiment.

1. Set some variables.
   This is assuming you are running the minimal application locally through `pnpm dev` and have not modified any contracts.
   If that is not correct in your case modify as needed.

   ```sh copy
   export ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
   WORLD_ADDR=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
   PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
   COUNTER_TABLE=0x00000000000000000000000000000000436f756e746572000000000000000000
   ```

   The convention (which is not enforced by onchain code) for identifying tables is to have two ASCII strings, one starting in byte 0 (namespace) and one starting in byte 16 (table name).
   The values are then padded with zeros to make them into 16 bytes.

   If the case of `Counter`, the namespace is empty (it is in the root namespace) and the name of the table is `Counter`.
   [You can see the code that calculates that `tableId` in the template](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/vanilla/packages/contracts/src/codegen/tables/Counter.sol#L20-L21).
   You can also use [this calculator](https://www.duplichecker.com/text-to-hex.php) to translate text into ASCII hexadecimal.

1. Get the value schema for `Counter`.

   ```sh copy
   COUNTER_VAL_SCHEMA=`cast call $WORLD_ADDR "getValueSchema(bytes32)" $COUNTER_TABLE`
   ```

   [Here is the `getValueSchema` function](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/store/src/StoreRead.sol#L13-L15).

1. Read the counter value.

   ```sh
   cast call $WORLD_ADDR 'getRecord(bytes32,bytes32[] calldata,bytes32)' $COUNTER_TABLE '[]' $COUNTER_VAL_SCHEMA
   ```

   **Add explanation how to interpret this value**
