# Players and movement

In this section, we will accomplish the following:

- Spawn in each unique wallet address as an entity with the `Player`, `Movable`, and `Position` components.
- Operate on a player's `Position` component with a system to create movement.
- Optimistically render player movement in the client.

## Create the components as tables

To create tables in MUD we are going to edit the `mud.config.ts` file.
You can define tables, their types, their schemas, and other types of information here.
MUD then autogenerates all of the files needed to make sure your app knows these tables exist.

We're going to start by defining three new tables:

- `Player: 'bool'` - determine which entities are players (e.g. distinct wallet addresses).
- `Movable: 'bool'` - determine whether or not an entity can move.
- `Position: { valueSchema: { x: 'uint32', y: 'uint32' } }` - determine which position an entity is located on a 2D grid.

The syntax is as follows:

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="packages/contract/mud.config.ts" {8-16} copy showLineNumbers
import { mudConfig } from "@latticexyz/world/register";

export default mudConfig({
  enums: {
    // TODO
  },
  tables: {
    Movable: "bool",
    Player: "bool",
    Position: {
      dataStruct: false,
      valueSchema: {
        x: "uint32",
        y: "uint32",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</CollapseCode>

<details>

<summary>Explanation</summary>

```typescript
    Movable: "bool",
    Player: "bool",
```

When we do not specify a key schema for a table, MUD uses the default, a `bytes32` value.
The key in these cases is the entity ID for the entities being described.
As in most cases in the Ethereum ecosystem, there is no distinction between zero (or in the case of boolean values, `false`) and nothing.
So by default entites are neither `Movable` nor a `Player`.

```typescript
    Position: {
      dataStruct: false,
      valueSchema: {
        x: "uint32",
        y: "uint32",
      },
```

The `Position` of an entity includes both an `x` coordinate and a `y` coordinate.
When a table has multiple fields, we use `valueSchema` inside a structure to describe them instead of just using a string with the Solidity field type.

</details>

If after modifying the file you get an error on the `pnpm dev` process, restart it.

## Create the map system and its methods

In MUD, a system can have an arbitrary number of methods inside of it.
Since we will be moving players around on a 2D map, we start the codebase off by creating a system that will encompass all of the methods related to the map: `MapSystem.sol` in `packages/contracts/src/systems`.

### Spawn method

Before we add in the functionality of users moving we need to make sure each user is being properly identified as a player with the position and movable table. The former gives us a means of operating on it to create movement, and the latter allows us to grant the entity permission to use the move system.

To solve for these problems we can add the **spawn method**, which will assign the `Player`, `Position`, and `Movable` tables we created earlier, inside of `MapSystem.sol`.

<CollapseCode>

```solidity filename="packages/contract/src/systems/MapSystem.sol" {4-5,8-15} copy showLineNumbers
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;
import { System } from "@latticexyz/world/src/System.sol";
import { Movable, Player, Position } from "../codegen/index.sol";
import { addressToEntityKey } from "../addressToEntityKey.sol";

contract MapSystem is System {
  function spawn(uint32 x, uint32 y) public {
    bytes32 player = addressToEntityKey(address(_msgSender()));
    require(!Player.get(player), "already spawned");

    Player.set(player, true);
    Position.set(player, x, y);
    Movable.set(player, true);
  }

  function distance(uint32 fromX, uint32 fromY, uint32 toX, uint32 toY) internal pure returns (uint32) {
    uint32 deltaX = fromX > toX ? fromX - toX : toX - fromX;
    uint32 deltaY = fromY > toY ? fromY - toY : toY - fromY;
    return deltaX + deltaY;
  }
}
```

</CollapseCode>

<details>

<summary>Explanation</summary>

```solidity
import { Movable, Player, Position } from "../codegen/index.sol";
```

Import the components we use from the automatically generated table list.

```solidity
import { addressToEntityKey } from "../addressToEntityKey.sol";
```

[This function](https://github.com/latticexyz/emojimon/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/addressToEntityKey.sol) converts an address, use as the player's, to a `bytes32` value that can identify an entity.

```solidity
  function spawn(uint32 x, uint32 y) public {
```

The `spawn` function spawns a new player entity on the map.

```solidity
    bytes32 player = addressToEntityKey(address(_msgSender()));
```

In certain cases systems are called by [a MUD `World`](/world) using the call opcode.
In that case, `msg.sender()` is the `World` that called the system, not the actual player.
`_msgSender()` takes care of this and gives us the real user identity, the one who called the `World`.

```solidity
    require(!Player.get(player), "already spawned");
```

To get a component value we use `<Component name>.get(<entity>)`.

```solidity
    Player.set(player, true);
    Position.set(player, x, y);
    Movable.set(player, true);
  }
```

To set a component value we use `<Component name>.set(<entity>, <value>)`.

</details>

As you see, writing systems and their methods in MUD is similar to writing regular smart contracts. The key difference is that their state is defined and stored in tables rather than in the system contract itself.

### Move method

Next we’ll add the **move method** to `MapSystem.sol`. This will allow us to move users (e.g. the user's wallet address as their entityID) by updating their `Position` table.

<CollapseCode>

```solidity filename="packages/contract/src/systems/MapSystem.sol" {17-25} copy showLineNumbers
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;
import { System } from "@latticexyz/world/src/System.sol";
import { Movable, Player, Position } from "../codegen/index.sol";
import { addressToEntityKey } from "../addressToEntityKey.sol";

contract MapSystem is System {
  function spawn(uint32 x, uint32 y) public {
    bytes32 player = addressToEntityKey(address(_msgSender()));
    require(!Player.get(player), "already spawned");

    Player.set(player, true);
    Position.set(player, x, y);
    Movable.set(player, true);
  }

  function move(uint32 x, uint32 y) public {
    bytes32 player = addressToEntityKey(_msgSender());
    require(Movable.get(player), "cannot move");

    (uint32 fromX, uint32 fromY) = Position.get(player);
    require(distance(fromX, fromY, x, y) == 1, "can only move to adjacent spaces");

    Position.set(player, x, y);
  }

  function distance(uint32 fromX, uint32 fromY, uint32 toX, uint32 toY) internal pure returns (uint32) {
    uint32 deltaX = fromX > toX ? fromX - toX : toX - fromX;
    uint32 deltaY = fromY > toY ? fromY - toY : toY - fromY;
    return deltaX + deltaY;
  }
}
```

This method will allow users to interact with a smart contract, auto-generated by MUD, to update their position.
However, we are not yet able to visualize this on the client, so let's add that to make it feel more real.

## Modify the user interface to call the map system

We’ll fill in the `moveTo` and `moveBy` and `spawn` methods in our client’s `createSystemCalls.ts`.

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="packages/client/src/mud/createSystemCalls.ts" {11,14-19,23-33,37-47} copy showLineNumbers
import { Has, HasValue, getComponentValue, runQuery } from "@latticexyz/recs";
import { uuid } from "@latticexyz/utils";
import { MonsterCatchResult } from "../monsterCatchResult";
import { ClientComponents } from "./createClientComponents";
import { SetupNetworkResult } from "./setupNetwork";

export type SystemCalls = ReturnType<typeof createSystemCalls>;

export function createSystemCalls(
  { playerEntity, worldContract, waitForTransaction }: SetupNetworkResult,
  { Player, Position }: ClientComponents
) {
  const moveTo = async (x: number, y: number) => {
    if (!playerEntity) {
      throw new Error("no player");
    }

    const tx = await worldContract.write.move([x, y]);
    await waitForTransaction(tx);
  };

  const moveBy = async (deltaX: number, deltaY: number) => {
    if (!playerEntity) {
      throw new Error("no player");
    }

    const playerPosition = getComponentValue(Position, playerEntity);
    if (!playerPosition) {
      console.warn("cannot moveBy without a player position, not yet spawned?");
      return;
    }

    await moveTo(playerPosition.x + deltaX, playerPosition.y + deltaY);
  };

  const spawn = async (x: number, y: number) => {
    if (!playerEntity) {
      throw new Error("no player");
    }

    const canSpawn = getComponentValue(Player, playerEntity)?.value !== true;
    if (!canSpawn) {
      throw new Error("already spawned");
    }

    const tx = await worldContract.write.spawn([x, y]);
    await waitForTransaction(tx);
  };

  const throwBall = async () => {
    // TODO
    return null as any;
  };

  const fleeEncounter = async () => {
    // TODO
    return null as any;
  };

  return {
    moveTo,
    moveBy,
    spawn,
    throwBall,
    fleeEncounter,
  };
}
```

</CollapseCode>

<details>

<summary>Explanation</summary>

```ts
export function createSystemCalls(
  { playerEntity, worldContract, waitForTransaction }: SetupNetworkResult,
```

From the network setup we get the user identity (`playerEntity`), the address of the `World` we use, and the function to wait for a transaction to be included.

```ts
  { Player, Position }: ClientComponents
```

The client code that uses the system calls needs the `Player` and `Position` components, as you'll see below.

```ts
) {
  const moveTo = async (x: number, y: number) => {
```

This function moves the user to a specific location.

```ts
const tx = await worldContract.write.move([x, y]);
await waitForTransaction(tx);
```

This (`worldContract.write.<method>`) is the way we call a method on a system at the root namespace.

```ts
  const moveBy = async (deltaX: number, deltaY: number) => {
    ...
  }
```

This is a helper function to move the user a certain direction.

```ts
  const spawn = async (x: number, y: number) => {
    ...
  }
```

Spawn a new player.
It is very similar to `moveTo` avove.

```ts
  return {
    moveTo,
    moveBy,
    spawn,
    throwBall,
    fleeEncounter,
  };
}
```

Return the functions in a structure so they can be called.

</details>

Now we can apply all of these backend changes to the client by updating `GameBoard.tsx` to spawn the player when a map tile is clicked, show the player on the map, and move the player with the keyboard.

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="packages/client/src/GameBoard.tsx" {1,3-4,7-28} copy showLineNumbers
import { useComponentValue } from "@latticexyz/react";
import { GameMap } from "./GameMap";
import { useMUD } from "./MUDContext";
import { useKeyboardMovement } from "./useKeyboardMovement";

export const GameBoard = () => {
  useKeyboardMovement();

  const {
    components: { Player, Position },
    network: { playerEntity },
    systemCalls: { spawn },
  } = useMUD();

  const canSpawn = useComponentValue(Player, playerEntity)?.value !== true;

  const playerPosition = useComponentValue(Position, playerEntity);
  const player =
    playerEntity && playerPosition
      ? {
          x: playerPosition.x,
          y: playerPosition.y,
          emoji: "🤠",
          entity: playerEntity,
        }
      : null;

  return <GameMap width={20} height={20} onTileClick={canSpawn ? spawn : undefined} players={player ? [player] : []} />;
};
```

## Add optimistic rendering

You may notice that your movement on the game board is laggy.
While this is the default behavior of even web2 games (e.g. lag between user actions and client-side rendering), this problem is worsened by the need to wait on transaction confirmations on a blockchain.

A commonly used pattern in game development is the addition of _optimistic rendering_—client-side code that assumes a successful user action and renders it in the client before the server agrees, or, in this case, before the transaction is confirmed.

This pattern has a trade-off, especially on the blockchain: it can potentially create a worse user experience when transactions fail, but it creates a _much_ smoother experience when the optimistic assumption proves to be true.

MUD provides an easy way to add optimistic rendering.
First we need to override our `Position` component on the client to add optimistic updates. Let’s go ahead and do this in `createClientComponents.ts`.

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="packages/client/src/mud/createClientComponents.ts" {9-10} showLineNumbers copy
import { overridableComponent } from "@latticexyz/recs";
import { SetupNetworkResult } from "./setupNetwork";

export type ClientComponents = ReturnType<typeof createClientComponents>;

export function createClientComponents({ components }: SetupNetworkResult) {
  return {
    ...components,
    Player: overridableComponent(components.Player),
    Position: overridableComponent(components.Position),
  };
}
```

</CollapseCode>

Now we can update our `createSystemCalls.ts` methods to apply an optimistic update before we send the transaction and remove the optimistic update once the transaction completes.

Copy the code below and replace the existing `createSystemCalls.ts` method.

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="packages/client/src/mud/createSystemCalls.ts" {18-22,24,27-29,56-65,67,70-73} copy showLineNumbers
import { getComponentValue } from "@latticexyz/recs";
import { ClientComponents } from "./createClientComponents";
import { SetupNetworkResult } from "./setupNetwork";
import { singletonEntity } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/recs";
import { uuid } from "@latticexyz/utils";

export type SystemCalls = ReturnType<typeof createSystemCalls>;

export function createSystemCalls(
  { playerEntity, worldContract, waitForTransaction }: SetupNetworkResult,
  { Player, Position }: ClientComponents
) {
  const moveTo = async (x: number, y: number) => {
    if (!playerEntity) {
      throw new Error("no player");
    }

    const positionId = uuid();
    Position.addOverride(positionId, {
      entity: playerEntity,
      value: { x, y },
    });

    try {
      const tx = await worldContract.write.move([x, y]);
      await waitForTransaction(tx);
    } finally {
      Position.removeOverride(positionId);
    }
  };

  const moveBy = async (deltaX: number, deltaY: number) => {
    if (!playerEntity) {
      throw new Error("no player");
    }

    const playerPosition = getComponentValue(Position, playerEntity);
    if (!playerPosition) {
      console.warn("cannot moveBy without a player position, not yet spawned?");
      return;
    }

    await moveTo(playerPosition.x + deltaX, playerPosition.y + deltaY);
  };

  const spawn = async (x: number, y: number) => {
    if (!playerEntity) {
      throw new Error("no player");
    }

    const canSpawn = getComponentValue(Player, playerEntity)?.value !== true;
    if (!canSpawn) {
      throw new Error("already spawned");
    }

    const positionId = uuid();
    Position.addOverride(positionId, {
      entity: playerEntity,
      value: { x, y },
    });
    const playerId = uuid();
    Player.addOverride(playerId, {
      entity: playerEntity,
      value: { value: true },
    });

    try {
      const tx = await worldContract.write.spawn([x, y]);
      await waitForTransaction(tx);
    } finally {
      Position.removeOverride(positionId);
      Player.removeOverride(playerId);
    }
  };

  const throwBall = async () => {
    // TODO
    return null as any;
  };

  const fleeEncounter = async () => {
    // TODO
    return null as any;
  };

  return {
    moveTo,
    moveBy,
    spawn,
    throwBall,
    fleeEncounter,
  };
}
```

</CollapseCode>

Try moving the player around with the keyboard now. It should feel much snappier!

Now that we have players, movement, and a basic map, let's start making improvements to the map itself.
