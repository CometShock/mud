# Getting started

## Prerequisites

1. git ([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
2. foundry (forge, anvil, cast) ([download](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), make sure toÂ `foundryup`Â at least once)
3. node.js (v17+) ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
4. pnpm (`npm install pnpm --global` after installing node)

## Setup

Most projects in MUD are started by running `pnpm create mud <project name>`, but for this tutorial we've included some initial code to get you up and running quicker. This includes React components and base TailwindCSS styles.

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash copy
   git clone https://github.com/latticexyz/emojimon.git
   ```

1. Install the dependencies and start up MUD's services (anvil node, contracts deployer, and client).

   ```bash copy
   cd emojimon && pnpm install
   ```

1. Run the game.

   ```bash copy
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   When the application is ready, you should see this on the command line:

   ```
    [contracts]
    [contracts] Deployment completed in 13.305 seconds
    [contracts]
    [contracts]  Deployment result (written to ./worlds.json and deploys/31337):
    [contracts]
    [contracts] {
    [contracts]   worldAddress: '0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3',
    [contracts]   blockNumber: 12
    [contracts] }
    [contracts]
    [contracts] .------..------..------.
    [contracts] |M.--. ||U.--. ||D.--. |
    [contracts] | (\/) || (\/) || :/\: |
    [contracts] | :\/: || :\/: || (__) |
    [contracts] | '--'M|| '--'U|| '--'D|
    [contracts] '------''------''------'
    [contracts]
    [contracts] MUD watching for changes...
   ```

1. After deployment is successful, browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the application.

   1. Click anywhere on the map to place your character (`ðŸ¤ `).
   1. Move your character using the arrow keys.
      Note that you can only make one move per block (every second).
   1. When you meet a wild creature you can _Throw_ to catch it, or _Run_ to stop the encounter.
