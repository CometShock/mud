# Tooling for other environments

The main client-side feature of MUD is _synchronization_, having a local on-client copy of the up-to-date state of the `World` object.
To support other environments, such as [Unity](https://unity.com/) or [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), this is the main functionality that needs to be ported.

The initial synchronization is best done using the [Indexer](indexer) to get the starting state.
The Indexer is written in TypeScript, but it can be [accessed through HTTP](./indexer#using-http)

Once the client is in sync, it can listen to blockchain events emitted by the `World` to update the local copy of the state as needed.
This is a lot more efficient than reading the entire state of the world from the Indexer repeatedly.
