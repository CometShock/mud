# Function selectors

If you call a `System` using [`call`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/World.sol#L339-L351).
If [you have the necessary delegation](/world/account-delegation) you can also use `callFrom`.
When you use this method, you provide two parameters:

- The `ResourceId` for the `System` to be called.
- The [calldata](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) to send that system.
  This calldata includes the four-byte [function signature](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html#function-selector), as well as any function parameters.

The problem with this method is that the caller needs to encode the calldata and then send it to the `World`.
This is not as developer-friendly as using the standard mechanism the library provides to call a contract (usually this is `<contract object>.<function>(<args>)`).

The solution is to register a function selector, which allows `System` functions to be called in the usual way by calling the `World` contract.
Once the namespace owner does this, anybody can use `<World contract object>.<namespace_<system>_<function>(<args>)`.

To register a function selector, you use [`<world>.registerFunctionSelector`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/core/implementations/WorldRegistrationSystem.sol#L164-L201).
This function takes two parameters:

- The `ResourceID` of the `System`.
  This value encodes both the name space and the name of the `System`.
- The name of the function within the `System`.

For example, in the [Extending World guide](/guides/extending-world#deploy-to-the-blockchain) we create a namespace called `messaging`, within it a `System` called `message`, and that `System` includes a function called `incrementMessage`.

This is the code we use to register the `System` and the function selector:

```solidity
    ResourceId systemResource = WorldResourceIdLib.encode(RESOURCE_SYSTEM, "messaging", "message");
    world.registerSystem(systemResource, messageSystem, true);
    world.registerFunctionSelector(systemResource, "incrementMessage(string)");
```

And this is the command line that uses [`cast`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) to call `incrementMessage`:

```sh
cast send $WORLD_ADDRESS --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY "messaging_message_incrementMessage(string)" "hello"
```

## Root systems

The [systems in the root namespace](/world/systems#root-systems) behave a bit differently.
If you need to register a function selector for a root `System` (and you're the owner of the root namespace), you use [`registerRootFunctionSelector`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/core/implementations/WorldRegistrationSystem.sol#L203-L232). This function has three parameters:

- The system ID
- The signature of the World function (as a string)
- The selector of the system function (as the four-byte signature)

This means that the `World`'s function name for a function in a root `System` can be any string, it does not need to correlate to the name inside the `System`.
