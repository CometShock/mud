# Tables

- Tables in a World are the same as Tables in a Store (see Store docs), but with access control.
- The World is the Store contract that stores all the data.
- Systems write to storage either internally (StoreCore) or externally (IStore). StoreSwitch in the Table libraries figures out which one to use (depending on whether the system is a root system or not)
- External writes go through access control (see access control for details)
