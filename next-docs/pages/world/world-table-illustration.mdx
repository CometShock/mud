![Interaction between the `World`, a `System`, and a table](./world-table.svg)

1. An account calls a function called `namespace_system_function` via the `World`.
   This means the `fun` function in the `sys` system, which is part of the `myns` namespace (the system is also refered to as `myns:sys`).

2. The `World` verifies that access is permitted (for example, because `myns:sys` is publicly accessible) and if so calls `fun` on the `myns:sys` contract with the provided parameters.

3. At some point in its execution `fun` decides to update the data in the table `myns:tab`.
   As with all other tables, this table is stored in the `World`'s storage.
   To modify it, `fun` calls a function on the `World` contract.

4. The `World` verifies that access is permitted (by default it would be, because `myns:sys` has access to the `myns` namespace).
   If so, it modifies the data in the `myns:tab` table.
