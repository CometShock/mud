# Namespaces and Access Control

- Access control is based on namespaces
- Every resource (e.g. systems, tables) in the world has an ID.
- The first two bytes represent the type of resource (e.g. system, table, etc.)
- The next 14 bytes represent the namespace
- The last 16 bytes represent the name of the resource
- Anyone can register a new namespace in the World, which makes them the owner of the namespace
- The owner of a namespace can register new resources in that namespace and grant access to other actors
- Access can be granted to a specific resource or all resources in a namespace
- Systems registered in a namespace are automatically given access to all resources in that namespace
- Ownership of namespaces can be transferred.
- If ownership is transferred to the 0 address, it's considered burned. 
  After this happens, no new resources can be registered in the namespace, access can't be changed, and ownership can't be transferred again. 
  Note that if you want to prove that the app is truly decentralized and nobody can modify the data, you need to revoke all access before you transfer the ownership.

Things only the owner of a namespace can do:

- Register new tables
- Register new systems
- Upgrade existing systems
- Manage access
- Transfer ownership
- Register a namespace delegation control
- Register system hooks for systems in the namespace
- Register store hooks for tables in the namespace
- Register function selectors for systems in the namespace

Things accounts with access to a namespace can do:

- Write to tables in the namespace
- Call private systems in the namespace
- Access the balance of the namespace (if this is not intended, grant access to individual resources instead of the whole namespace)
